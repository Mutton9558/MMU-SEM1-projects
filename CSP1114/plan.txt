Game idea
Runes of Minigames

Concept: Based around small minigames

Idea: There will be an initial story where the protagonists fell through a well and stumbled upon a dark abyss. They need to traverse a special dungeon to get out.
As he travels through the dungeon, he meets several characters who acts as bosses. They force the mc to play a minigame to advance to the next level. If the mc can beat all the bosses
they escape.

Characters: MC character can be a small block idgaf
	    Computer: Likes rock, papers, scissors. Never got to play cuz he has no friends.
	    Cat: Connect 4 champion. He's a cheater though and can move twice per turn.
	    Magician: That cup shuffling game except he doesn't show you how he shuffles it but he gives one clue. Play 3 times.
	    Apple: He creates a maze. Find 5 apples you advance. There are orbs around the maze, if you stumble upon one you lose one apple.
	    Chicken: CROSS THE ROAD YOOOOOO
