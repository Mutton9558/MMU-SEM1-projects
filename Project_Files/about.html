                    <h2>About our Product</h2>
                    <h3>What is our Product?</h3>
                    <p>Our product is a tightly-cut and top-notch edited YouTube video discussing about the System Unit.
                    It delves deep into the roles that each computer component plays to keeping the System Unit running.
                    These components are: Central Processing Unit (CPU), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), Motherboard, Solid-State Drive (SSD) and the Power Supply Unit (PSU).</p>
                    <h3>Why did we choose this as our Product?</h3>
                    <p>We chose this as we envisioned a product that is rich in information and can be constantly replayed over and over again.
                    Besides that, we also wanted to use a medium that appeals to the new generation.
                    Thus, we came up the idea of an information-based YouTube video. We chose an editing style which suits our target audience which are university students.</p>
                    <h3>Which software did we use for editing?</h3>
                    <p>We used the free-to-use and light editing software VSDC Editor for our video.
                    The reason was that this editing software can be run on lower-end laptops and provided enough features needed for the video.</p>
                    <h3>How will this product help the user?</h3>
                    <p>This product is able to help the user by providing detailed information of each computer components and how they relate to each other.
                    For example: It talks about all the inner parts of the CPU and how it processes data and instructions into information.
                    The medium used will help users understand more clearly on the topic discussed while maintaining a fun and entertaining content.</p>

                        <p>Our website, Tech Squad, is a website made to advertise our product and show the world what it is about.
                        It features the video itself and also shows the journey and processes we took to create it. We also learnt a lot of 
                        things while making the video which is documented on this website. In addition, this website is dedicated to guiding others who are researching on this topic and encourage self learning among students!</p>
                        <h3>Who does this website benefit?</h3>
                        <p>This website mainly benefits students who are studying on topics related to the System Unit and the hardware of a computer.
                        Besides that, this website also helps individuals who are willing to self-learn or have zero knowledge about the components within their computer.
                        Therefore, this website is aims to be the go-to spot for learning about the System Unit.</p>
                        <h3>Why should we view this website?</h3>
                        <p>Users are able to view our YouTube video regarding the System Unit only through this website.
                            Users are also able understand the processes behing self-learning and have a role model to follow when doing these sort of projects.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How did the name Tech Squad come about?</h3>
                        <p>The name "Tech Squad" was chosen randomly one day when we were discussing about the name of this website.
                        The word "Tech" in our name is a shortened version of the word Technology that reflects on the topic that we are doing meanwhile "Squad" represents our team effort.
                        Therefore, the name was creatively crafted so as to remain relevant to what we do while also appealing to a younger audience.</p>
