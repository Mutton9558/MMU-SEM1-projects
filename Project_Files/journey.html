                    <h2>The Video</h2>
                    <h3>Planning the video</h3>
                    <p>We embarked on an engaging exploration of computer system units, aiming to highlight their importance in a fun and creative way. After brainstorming various ideas, we settled on creating a lively PNG animation video featuring the system units engaged in a spirited debate about who holds the title of ‘most crucial.’</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Gathering the necessary Assets</h3>
                    <p>To bring our vision to life, we had to obtain digital illuxstrations of each system unit, ensuring that their appearance and personality aligned seamlessly with their respective voiceovers.
                    In order to achieve this, we managed to arrange a commission with an artist who chose to remain unnamed.
                    Additionally, we gathered additional images such a background pictures and other more that would improve our video viewing experience.
                    Afterwards, we compiled them all into one folder and proceeded for the editing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Audio</h3>
                    <p>Each one of us recorded our audios for the video. The details of who voiced who can be found in "Our Members" pages.
                    We edited each audio through a software called Audacity to enhance clarity and impact.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Editing</h3>
                    <p>Editing was done by Shawn through a software called VSDC Editor.
                    Editing was by far the longest process of the entire video production as each clip must be examined to provide a perfect video.
                    Most of our free time was spent on the editing and many reattempts was done to ensure a high-quality video would be produced.
                    Along the way, many aspects of editing had to be learnt for the first time and it certainly thought us more things about it.
                    For example, applying many video effects such as gaussian blurring and a type-writer effect for the opening sequence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Publishing</h3>
                    <p>Once everything was polished and perfected, we proudly shared our work by uploading it to YouTube
                    The title and description was carefully written so as to encapsulate the true meaning behind our video and to also gain the attention of our intended audience
                    We added subtitles in both English and Malay to widen our audience even further and also to ensure viewers are able to understand the video
                    These subtitles also help viewers who suffer from disabilities such as deafness.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, we did not forget to share the references we used for the video.</p>

                <h2>Creation of the website</h2>
                <h3>Planning the Website</h3>
                <p>After completing our video, we decided to make a website dedicated to advertising our effort. For some of us, 
                    this is the first time we have embarked on such a large-scale project. Therefore, proper planning 
                    was necessary in order to create an orderly website that can appeal to the users.
                    Through thorough planning we came up with the name and the overall design of this website. We also decided
                    the content we wanted to add including the video itself. As soon as the planning was done, we quickly started working
                    on this website. Thanks to our meticulous planning, you are able to view this website today.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Coding the Website</h3>
                <p>From the planning, we came up with an overall draft of this website. We refer to draft for most of our design
                    choices. This website was written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) as it is needed
                    for web creation. We spent a lot of time trying to get used to the languages and eventually was able to pull through.
                    We extensively used a lot of HTML and CSS functions such as hyperlinks, tables and much more! Overall, this part
                    of the process was really fun.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Gathering Images</h3>
                <p>To furthermore strengthen our desire to appeal towards a younger audience, we gathered a lot of images mostly to be used
                    as a background image for some of our web pages. Many of these background images are from popular "Animes" that
                    a lot of youngsters and youths can relate to. We also had to gather pictures of ourselves.
